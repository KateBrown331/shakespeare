470 Info Storage and Retrieval Final Project

This is a Shakespeare Line Finder!

Start the app with `python3 app.py` -- `python` version should be 3.10 or later.

Please note!

You may need to use Git LFS to pull the large file that stores semantic embeddings from Shakespeare. 

Get Git LFS:
`sudo apt install git-lfs`
intialize:
`git lfs install`
pull:
`git lfs pull`

And start searching! Give us your best guess of what the line says or means -- just the 'gist' should be fine, and we'll give you the best matches in Shakespeare's work!

If you're looking for a line from a specific play, or if you know in which act or scene it occurs in the play, you'll have an even better chance of finding your line. You can filter by play title, act number, and scene number on the search page.
